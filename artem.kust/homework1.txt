1. Create merge conflict and resolve it

git branch ConflictBranch
git checkout ConflictBranch
touch conflict.py
git add conflict.py
git commit -m "The new conflict file has been added" 
vi conflic.py
This text just for testing
git add conflict.py
git commit -m "The new conflict file has been modified" 
git checkout master
vi conflic.py
This text just for testing as well
git add conflict.py
git commit -m "The conflict file has been modified from master branch as well"
git merge ConflictBranch
//CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in conflict.py
//Auto-merging conflict.py
//Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
vi conflict.py
//Make some changes to solve the problem and save it
git add conflict.py
git commit -m "The issue has been fixed"
git merge ConflictBranch

2. Create branch, push it to remote with different name, delete it from remote only

git checkout -b BranchForTesting
git push origin BranchForTesting:BranchForTesting2
git push origin --delete BranchForTesting2
